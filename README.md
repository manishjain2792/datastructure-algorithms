``MaximumDifference.java`` <br/>
#####Question : Given an array arr[] of integers, find out the maximum difference between any two elements such that larger element appears after the smaller number.<br/>
Input : arr = {2, 3, 10, 6, 4, 8, 1} <br/>
Output : 8 <br/>
Explanation : The maximum difference is between 10 and 2.<br/>
Logic : The function assumes that there are  at least two elements in array. The function returns a negative value if the array is sorted in decreasing order and returns 0 if elements are equal.<br>
